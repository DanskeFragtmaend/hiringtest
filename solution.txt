### Update method: ###
if (truck == null) throw new NullReferenceException("truck is null");
var t = trucks.FirstOrDefault(x => x.LicensePlate == licensePlate);
if (t == null)
    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(licensePlate), $"A truck with the given license plate {licensePlate} wasn't found.");
t.Owner = truck.Owner;
t.Weight = truck.Weight;

### Missing from bSaveTruck_Click API call: ###
+"/"+this.selectedTruck.LicensePlate
$"{apiUri}/{this.selectedTruck.LicensePlate}"

What about tests?

The button can be clicked multiple times. How can we fix it?

What happens if ITruckRepository.Add is called multiple times with the same license plate? How can we fix it?
